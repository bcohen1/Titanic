# Predicting Titanic Survival
Use a variety of classifcation algorithms including Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to predict Titanic survival based on the provided feature set.
# How it Works
Data is pre-processed (e.g., cleaned and encoded) and then each untuned classification model is cross-validated to determine best performing models. Then a grid search is performed to tune hyperparameters for best possible model performance.
